## **Details**

- Type: term project
- Teacher: 黄汉青
- Computer Language: C++, OpenGL, ...
- Project Name: Animation of the Solar System
- Time: 2020/12/12
- Description: In this project, you are going to implement a single cycle CPU simulator called MiniCPU using C language. Your MiniCPU will demonstrate some functions of MIPS processors as well as the principle of the datapath and the control signals. MiniCPU should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS processor does cycle-by-cycle. AC file called component.c will be provided to you which implementing each component of the single-cycle datapath, you are required to modify and fill in the body of the functions in this file.

## **Dependencies:** 

- glew32.dll file (./code/tools)
- source_after_compile(OpenGLtemplate).rar



## **Install package:**

- see Installation and setup for PC.pdf




## **Run program:**

- Configure the environment
- Copy the tools/glew.dll file to the Debug folder in the **root directory**
- Put the *.cpp file in the resource folder
- Put the *.h file in the header folder
